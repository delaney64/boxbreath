## üéØ What is Box Breathing?

Box breathing (also known as square breathing) is a powerful stress-relief technique used by Navy SEALs, athletes, and mindfulness practitioners. The pattern is simple:

1. **Inhale** for 4 seconds
2. **Hold** for 4 seconds  
3. **Exhale** for 4 seconds
4. **Hold** for 4 seconds

This creates a "box" pattern that helps calm the nervous system, reduce stress, and improve focus.

## üé® Animation Details

The app features carefully crafted animations that create a living, breathing experience:

All transitions use `cubic-bezier` easing for natural, organic motion.

## üîß Development

### Project Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.js              # Main BoxBreathing component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js           # React entry point
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.css          # Global styles
```

### Key Components

- **Timer Logic** - Precise 4-second intervals for each phase
- **Animation System** - CSS transforms with conditional timing
- **State Management** - React hooks for phase and timer control
- **Responsive Design** - Tailwind utilities for all screen sizes

### Customization

You can easily customize the breathing pattern by modifying these values in `App.js`:

```javascript
// Change timing (currently 4 seconds each phase)
const PHASE_DURATION = 4;

// Modify scale values for expansion/contraction
const EXPANDED_SCALE = 1.5;
const CONTRACTED_SCALE = 0.7;

// Adjust colors for each phase
const PHASE_COLORS = {
  inhale: 'rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.4)',    // Blue
  holdFull: 'rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.4)',   // Green  
  exhale: 'rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.4)',     // Red
  holdEmpty: 'rgba(234, 179, 8, 0.4)'   // Yellow
};
```
